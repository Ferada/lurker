Prevents some types of accidental messages from being sent on IRC, to improve
lurking.

To lurk in a channel, run /lurk, which prevents you sending messages from that
window, and use /unlurk to message that window again.

The script always blocks messages that match three regular expressions:
Irssi window switch commands: /win\s*\d+/
Vim movement commands and noise: /^(f|j|k|\s|~|>|\.)+$/
Vim quit commands: /^(:wq|:w|:q|:WQ|:Wq)/
